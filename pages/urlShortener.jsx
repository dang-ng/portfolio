          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            There maybe many URL shorteners projects out there, but i found it
            quite great to start with because the project require to include
            many technologies learned in the lecture like python, flask,
            bootstrap, storing database and user cookies ... which is really
            help me to dive in and understand more about apply these
            technologies to real life.

            This app includes 2 parts: URL shortener and file upload into short
            URL. Both are great for sharing with friends. </p><br></br>
          <p>
            First you only need to input your desired URL you want to save for sharing/later uses. Then
            you input new easy-remember URL of your own. Click Shorten and voil√†,
            new URL has been created Later when needed, just copy new URL and
            send it to your friends or public elsewhere when they go to your
            link, it will redirect to original URL. All your new URLs are saved
            under cookies. Click it and it will also redirect to original URL.</p><br></br>
            <p>The second part is file sharing, which also under the form of new URL. 
            Click Choose File to select any file that you want to share Name of
            your new URL. And there you go: the new URL generated for sharing
            too! Just share it to your friends and they can see your file, or
            new photos! Whenever your input URLs that not exists yet, it will
            redirect to 404 page. Go back to home page and try again :) That&apos;s
            it! thank you for reading! :)
